# splitter
A python script which splits the rows of CSV file and saves them as individual CSV files. You can learn more about how and why I built this script in the blog post [Using Python to Make my Teaching Job Easier](https://ananfito.hashnode.dev/using-python-to-make-my-teaching-job-easier).

## Status

This script is ready for use, but may require some modification depending on where your files are saved locally and how you want to name them.
